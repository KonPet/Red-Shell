# Red-Shell
Level Editor for the Mario vs Luigi Python clone made in C++ using Raylib

## Controls:
* Use the mouse to draw the tiles into the big window
* Use `WASD` to scroll through the level
* Use `TAB` to change the width and height of the level
* Use `right- and leftclick` to select with which tiles you want to draw
* Use `Comma` and `Period` to increase / decrease the speed you're scrolling with

## Usage:
* To load a level, name it `level.lvl` and put it in the same folder as the `.exe`. Height and width will be loaded automatically and increased if necessary.
* If there's no `level.lvl` that the `.exe` can read (because it's not in the same folder), you're going to have to input width and height when starting the editor.
* To save the level, simply press the `ESCAPE` key in the main window.
